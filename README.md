# WebAssembly for Proxies (Go SDK) [![Build](https://github.com/tetratelabs/proxy-wasm-go-sdk/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tetratelabs/proxy-wasm-go-sdk/actions) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

The Go SDK for
 [Proxy-Wasm](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/spec), enabling developers to write Proxy-Wasm plugins in Go. 
This SDK is powered by [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) and does not support the official Go compiler.

## Getting Started

- [examples](examples) directory contains the example codes on top of this SDK.
- [OVERVIEW.md](doc/OVERVIEW.md) the overview of Proxy-Wasm, the API of this SDK, and the things you should know when writing plugins.

## Requirements

- [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) - This SDK depends on TinyGo and leverages its [WASI](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI) (WebAssembly System Interface) target. Please follow the official instruction [here](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/) for installing TinyGo.
- [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io) - To run compiled examples, you need to have Envoy binary. We recommend using [func-e](https://func-e.io) as the easiest way to get started with Envoy. Alternatively, you can follow [the official instruction](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/start/install).


## Installation

```
go get github.com/tetratelabs/proxy-wasm-go-sdk
```

## Build and run Examples

```bash
# Build all examples.
make build.examples

# Build a specific example.
make build.example name=helloworld

# Run a specific example.
make run name=helloworld
```

## Compatible Envoy builds

Envoy is the first host side implementation of Proxy-Wasm ABI, 
and we run end-to-end tests with multiple versions of Envoy and Envoy-based [istio/proxy](https://github.com/istio/proxy) in order to verify Proxy-Wasm Go SDK works as expected.

Please refer to [workflow.yaml](.github/workflows/workflow.yaml) for which version is used for End-to-End tests.

## Build tags

The following build tags can be used to customize the behavior of the built plugin:

- `proxywasm_timing`: Enables logging of time spent in invocation of the plugin's exported functions. This can be useful for debugging performance issues.
