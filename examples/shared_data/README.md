## shared_data

this example uses the shared key value store (across VMs) 
and increments the global value in response to http requests atomically.

```
wasm log: shared value: 1
wasm log: shared value: 2
wasm log: shared value: 3
wasm log: shared value: 4
wasm log: shared value: 5
wasm log: shared value: 6
wasm log: shared value: 7
wasm log: shared value: 8
wasm log: shared value: 9
wasm log: shared value: 10
wasm log: shared value: 11
wasm log: shared value: 12
wasm log: shared value: 13
wasm log: shared value: 14
wasm log: shared value: 15
wasm log: shared value: 16
wasm log: shared value: 17
wasm log: shared value: 18
wasm log: shared value: 19
wasm log: shared value: 20
wasm log: shared value: 21
wasm log: shared value: 22
wasm log: shared value: 23
wasm log: shared value: 24
