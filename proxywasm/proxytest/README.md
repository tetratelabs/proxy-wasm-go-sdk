##  test framework for proxy-wasm-go-sdk

With `proxytest` build tag, you can test your extension with the official command:

```
go test -tags=proxytest ./... 
```

This framework simulates the expected behavior of Envoyproxy, and you can test your extensions without running Envoy. 
For detail, see `examples/*/main_test.go`.


Note that we have not covered all the functionality, and the API is very likely to change in the future.
