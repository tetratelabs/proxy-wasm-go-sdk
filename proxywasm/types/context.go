// There four three types of "contexts" you are supposed to implement for writing Proxy-Wasm plugins with this SDK.
// They are called VMContext, PluginContext, TcpContext and HttpContext, and their relationship can be described as the following diagram:
// TODO: Add VM Context.
//
//              ╱ TcpContext = handling each Tcp stream
//             ╱
//            ╱ 1: N
//  PluginContext
//            ╲ 1: N
//             ╲
//              ╲ HttpContext = handling each Http stream
//
// In other words, RootContex is the parent of others, and responsible for creating Tcp and Http contexts
// corresponding to each streams if it is configured for running as a Http/Tcp stream plugin.
// Given that, PluginContext is the primary interface everyone has to implement.
//
type VMContext interface {
	// OnVMStart is called after the VM is created and main function is called.
	// During this call, GetVmConfiguration hostcall is available and can be used to
	// retrieve the configuration set at vm_config.configuration.
	//
	// Note that **only one root cnotext is called on this function**.
	// That is because there's Wasm VM: PluginContext = 1: N correspondence, and
	// the firstly created root context of these root contexts will be treated
	// as a *VM context* on which OnVMStart is invoked by host.
	// In other words, vm_config.configuration is only available for only one root context
	// which is created first.

// and the root context created first is specially treated as a VM context, which can handle
// vm_config.configuration during OnVMStart call to do VM-wise initialization.

	// hosts can kill this contexts.
